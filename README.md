Quantitative Forecasting Techniques:

Applied various quantitative approaches for forecasting, including Naive approach, Moving averages, Exponential smoothing, Trend projection, and Linear regression (Associative Model).
Components Analysis:

Analyzed Trend, Seasonal, and Cyclic components in the data to understand underlying patterns.
Impact Analysis of Smoothing Constant:

Investigated the impact of varying smoothing constants on forecasting accuracy.
Optimization of Smoothing Constant (Alpha):

Selected the optimal smoothing constant (alpha) by assessing forecast errors using preferred measures such as MAD, MSE, and MAPE.
Exponential Smoothing with Trend and Seasonal Variations:

Explored Exponential Smoothing with Trend Adjustment and Seasonal Variations, incorporating both Trend and Seasonal Indices.
Utilized Multiplicative Seasonal Index with Trend to enhance forecasting accuracy.
Associative Forecasting with Linear Regression:

Applied Associative Forecasting using linear regression analysis to identify and analyze correlations within the data.
Performance Measurement:

Utilized Tracking Signal Technique to measure how well the forecast predicted actual values.
